# pop-growth
This project was all about learning how to animate graphs using matplotlib. Just enter a city and the script will generate what I call a "snake graph" depicting population growth over time.

My inspiration to start this project came from a really interesting Medium article I read a while back. It was called *How to Create Animated Graphs in Python*.
